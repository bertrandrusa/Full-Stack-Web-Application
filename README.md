The final project documentation provides code in plain text so that it can be copied and pasted easily. Read the code carefully and recognize what is happening on the front end and on the back end. If you do not understand the logic or how the code works, please reach out to me so we can talk about it.

 

Rubric 

80 pts - Create (20) / Read (20) / Update (20) / and Delete (20) an address book contact successfully

05 pts - war file correctly spelled

15 pts - place your name in a comment at the top of every Java and JSP file. (points: all or nothing)
              In Java files, write        // first_name last_name
              In JSP files write          <!-- first_name, last_name  -->

Read the end of the documentation to learn how to create your WAR file.




IMPORTANT: The end of the documentation shows 

Common errors and fixes 
List of imports for each of your Java class files.
Make sure your WAR file is spelled properly (lastname-firstname-webapp.war.docx)

 

NOTICE YOU ARE BUILDING A WAR FILE! (NOT A ZIP FILE!) The lecture notes explain how to modify the pom.xml file and how to generate a WAR file. The notes also explain how to add .docx at the end so that MS Teams will accept the file. If the file is not accepted, then you did not change the end of the file correctly. Reach out to me if you run into problems, and I would be glad to help.

  

Common Question: What do you want us to turn in?
Answer: A WAR file that has been modified to have a .docx extension.


You all have been great! I am impressed with everyone's accomplishments this semester! Web development is super fun, and I hope you all have enjoyed it.

 

Feel free to reach out to me if you keep diving into web development and want further assistance/advice. Also feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about the O'Reilly Internship Program. 



Some of you asked to see a full stack web application using MySQL and Postgres. I will try to build the final project with both of these database engines and supply the source code and instructions by the end of the semester.
